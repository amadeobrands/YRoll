##Concept
A decentralized online payrolling platform for seamless processing of payments for people connected to centralized and decentralized organizations.
The distribution of value has a lot of costs by implementing blockchain technology costs can be reduced and new innovative ways of distributing value can be invented. Not only the distribution but also the stable storage of value for corporations and individuals can be significantly improved.

##Technical
An application inspired by ERC1620 (payment stream) tokens
This extends on the idea of a payment stream and strives to implement different types of stream:

- Fixed duration streams
- Pausable streams
- Multi-recipient streams
- Stream to Stream payments

- A combination of all the above

- Non fungible token streams?


-- todo

- Add more tests around streams specifically withdrawal of funds
- Stream to stream payments
- More events emitted
